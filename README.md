# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is my solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma sketch file, so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
